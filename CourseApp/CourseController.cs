Sure, I see that you're trying to access the element at index 5 of an array with a length of 6, which is out of bounds and causing a `FormatException`. To fix this, you need to ensure that the array has been initialized with a value at the specified index before trying to access it.
Here's the fixed code for the entire method:
```csharp
try
{
    string[] courses = new string[6];
    courses[5] = "Some value"; // Initialize the array with a value at the specified index
    Console.WriteLine(courses[5]);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Logger.LogError(ex);
    throw;
}
```
In this updated code, I've added a line to initialize the array with a value at index 5 before trying to access it. This should prevent the `FormatException` from being thrown.
}
